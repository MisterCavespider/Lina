#TODO LIST:

- See if `Lina` can connect with itself.
  - Maybe try to add an extra point. Altough unpractical, it might be the only solution.
- Make a `WireFrame`.
- Create some basic shapes in the factories
  - e.g.:
    - House
    - Cube
    - Cat
    - Monkey
    - Triangle
    - Pentagon
    - Circle (create shapes with low-level circles)
- Create an abstract class for adding Points.
- Maybe, _maybe_, create a special `WayPoint`: a Vector3f with additional info, like name.
- Create a tracer, or a control.
